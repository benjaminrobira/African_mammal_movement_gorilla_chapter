# :book: Western gorilla seasonal foraging tactic

## :file_folder: **What is this?**
The *R* script provides the code used to run the *R* analyses in the book chapter "Do seasonal frugivory and cognition shape foraging movements in wild western gorillas?", from Robira et al.

## :mag: **Limits**
- As the data are private, due to the vulnerability of the species studied, the code *R* has anonymised the group, and we regret that the data is not available to reproduce the analyses. However, the codes provided should allow those interested to perform similar analyses.
- Personal functions "discretisePathInSpace2", "resampleConstantTime2" or those in the "toolbox" can be available upon request, as they are constantly improved.
